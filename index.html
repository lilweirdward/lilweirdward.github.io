    <h1>My Work</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve been building various websites for over five years now, and I’ve come a long way from my very first website – a wedding website for my now-wife and I. This section of the portfolio is designed to showcase my best work, which is mostly the things that I’ve made most recently.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also check out my GitHub page at <a href="https://github.com/lilweirdward">https://github.com/lilweirdward</a> which will have some other projects I've worked on that may not be easy to put a "face" on for my portfolio. I'll include links to these in each individual project page.

    <h1>The Man Behind the Weirdward</h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently in my mid 20's, am married with a newborn baby and a very chubby dog, a graduate from the University of Louisville College of Business, and an avid soccer fan (#LouCityFC #COYI). I like to write and tweet probably-not-funny things, write amazing websites, hang out with friends and family, and end list sentences on a fourth item. My wife also loves penguins. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What can I say? I'm a man of few words, and one penguin.

    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>
      What's sad is that this used to be some snappy paragraph about how I've always wanted to write things and that you shouldn't read it, but unfortunately I've barely got the time to write things about my own websites, much less blog posts. I'm leaving this section of the website here in case that time ever does come, and also because it's the default template model for Jekyll, but maybe someday there will be something to read.

    <h1>Talk (not dirty) To Me</h1>
    <p>
        I was going to have a form here for you to email me (seriously, check the code - it's right there all in the commented out parts), but then I remembered that this whole site is static and I can't write any PHP code for it. Oh well. Here are some fancy links to a few websites that you can find me on!
