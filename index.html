    <h1>My Work</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve been building various websites for over three years now, and I’ve come a long way from my very first website – a wedding website for my now-wife and I. This section of the portfolio is designed to showcase my best work, which is mostly the things that I’ve made most recently. However, since I’ve worked in a breadth of languages, some progression in my learning should become apparent through various projects undertaken at different times. While I may not have five years of experience or entire libraries to showcase, the fact that I have a mostly non-school related portfolio of websites that I’ve built on my own time is something that I’m proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a side note: all of my code can be found in one of my publicly-hosted <a href="https://github.com/lilweirdward">GitHub repositories</a>. I'll include links to these in each individual project page.

    <h1>The Man Behind the Weirdward</h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently in my early 20's, already married with one dog, a recent graduate from the University of Louisville College of Business, and a semi-avid soccer fan (#LouCityFC) and FIFA player. I like to write and tweet probably-not-funny things, make sick websites, hang out with friends and family, and end list sentences on a fourth item. My wife also loves penguins. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What can I say? I'm a man of few words, and one penguin.

    <p>
      I always told myself that I wanted to have some sort of outlet to write things that no one needs to read. You know, a two-paragraph review of the movie I just watched saying that it's basically exactly how all the critics said it was except for that one thing? If I really want, I might throw in a retrospective piece on this cool new thing I did at work so you random passer-bys can be jealous of my cool, developer lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yeah, if I were you, I would probably not read any of these posts. Seriously, I have Google Analytics turned on, so I'll know if you did, and I'll just feel bad that someone made such a poor mistake. Just let me write terrible things in peace, please.

        I was going to have a form here for you to email me (seriously, check the code - it's right there all in the commented out parts), but then I remembered that this whole site is static and I can't write any PHP code for it. Oh well. Here are some fancy links to a few websites that you can find me on!
