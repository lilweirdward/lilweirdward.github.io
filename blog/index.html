			Sadly, I haven't figured out a solid style for my blog yet. Still working on that. I didn't want to hold up the development of the rest of my website for a blog I might not even use extensively though, and it's not like this is <em>horrible</em> or anything. Who knows, maybe one day I'll even get to paginate this bad boy.
