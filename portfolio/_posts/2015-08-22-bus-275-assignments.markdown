Probably my proudest moment was the one that I alluded to in the narrative for this section: when my Business 275 (Intro to Business Communication) professor told me that our final project design was the best that he’d seen from a student in all of his years of teaching. I’m pretty sure that I bragged about that to everyone that I knew, and did everything that I could to not annoy my teammates when we received a 100% for the assignment almost entirely because of the handout that I made. 

It was the culmination of an entire semester where I had taken a class intended simply for learning how to communicate in a business setting, and turned it into a competition with myself (and one other girl in the class who had started college in the Arts school) on how well I could design the various documents that we were assigned for the class. It turns out that I could design some pretty killer paper documents, and it gave me a lot of confidence going forward in my ability to be creative and think outside the box a bit.
