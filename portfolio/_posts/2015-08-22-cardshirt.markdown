I’ve worked with CardShirt since about August 2013 as their Vice President of I.T., which mostly has just entailed redesigning and rebuilding their website. Its most recent iteration not only involved a complete redesign, but also an implementation into Wordpress in order to allow for payment processing through the WooCommerce plugin. Below is some various code and screenshots of the project. Other than the layouts of the files, all of the included code was handwritten – no external libraries such as Bootstrap were used for the design.

# Code

Since the website was built on top of Wordpress, there isn't exactly a whole lot of unique code to post on here. Sure, the design was done by hand as usual, but I never really know how to post snippets of SASS in here. It's all just in a giant file [that you can scroll through yourself][css-file] if you'd like. Luckily for this post, though, there are a few files that I modified enough to be worth showing.

Note: All of this code can be found in the bones theme. Great theme by the way; I would really recommend it to anyone wanting to input their own style without having to write over or delete a mess of pre-done theme stuff.
