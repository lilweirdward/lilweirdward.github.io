I’ve worked with CardShirt since about August 2013 as their Vice President of I.T., which mostly has just entailed redesigning and rebuilding their website. Its most recent iteration not only involved a complete redesign, but also an implementation into Wordpress in order to allow for payment processing through the WooCommerce plugin. Below is some various code and screenshots of the project. Other than the layouts of the files, all of the included code was handwritten – no external libraries such as Bootstrap were used for the design.
