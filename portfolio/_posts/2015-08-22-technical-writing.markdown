# Business and Systems Analysis

In my opinion, the only two non-programming classes that were vitally important in the CIS major are CIS 320 (Systems Analysis and Design) and CIS 410 (Management of Information Systems). In 320, we learn how to take a real business problem, start from scratch, and architect a full solution for it. Then, in 410, we learn how to evaluate real businesses that already exist (or, for the most part, existed at some point in the past), and determine how to integrate information systems into those companies. When combined, they solve two extremely important problems that many I.T. kids frequently have: not understanding how to apply their programming knowledge to real-world companies, and not understanding how I.T. fits into the larger picture of business. They also help sharpen the business and technical writing and presentation skills of CIS students, as both classes are very writing- and speaking-intensive. 

The majority of the documents and assignments below consist of various diagrams and models (the result of 320), and various case reports (the result of 410). Combined, they should provide plenty of proof that the CIS program doesn’t just spit out code monkeys, but students who know how to make business use of their skills.

Disclaimer: CIS 320 is entirely group work, so I can’t take full credit for all of the work that was done. However, due to being tested on the material, I did have to at least understand how all of it was done, making it relevant to submit it all here.
