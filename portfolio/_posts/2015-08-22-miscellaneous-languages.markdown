# Other Programming Code

By the time that I was about to reach my sophomore year of college, I realized that I loved programming. I had no idea which language I wanted to learn, much less which technology stack or type of programming I wanted to do, but I knew that I wasn’t going to figure it out by not learning everything that I could. The CIS department only offered one language, which didn’t seem to do a whole lot of good for me at the time, so I went out of my way to find CECS professors who would vouch for me to take their programming classes even though I wasn’t a member of the Speed Engineering School. Within the span of two semesters, I learned C#, advanced C# (including data structures), C, C++, and Java.

Ironically, other than the fundamentals of C#, I haven’t made any practical use of any of these classes to date, other than being able to tutor them and get paid for it, which is why it’s the last programming section in my portfolio. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of value in all of the code that I wrote for those classes, especially in the sense that it shows my ability to learn any and every language thrown at me (and, in the case of some of my C code, learn some code humor as well).

# Code

Good lord, it's a lot of code, and I can't say that I have the time or energy to paste it all here right now. You can visit [the Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3vmvoymbm8onbpe/AACLZpbllNCGxB4ekPv5xwyMa?dl=0) to see each of the Word docs for each class. I have no idea if the link will actually work for more than one person though...
