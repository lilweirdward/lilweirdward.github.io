By the second semester of my junior year – early 2014, to be exact – at the University of Louisville, I’d been working at Blackstone Media for almost a year, and was starting to feel like a pro at making websites. I already had a certain design style that I was proud of, and I’d written enough C# and Coldfusion at Blackstone to feel confident that I could build a solid website on my own. I got my opportunity to try my new skills out in my CIS 420 class, which allows us to build an I.T. system (99% of the time this just means a website) for a real non-profit organization in Louisville. Our project was for a group called Restorative Justice Louisville, or RJLou for short, and our class was split into three teams that each competed to build the perfect website for the client. 

While my team may not have ultimately won the challenge, the client had struggled over whether to pick my team’s project or another’s, basically saying that she’d never seen a design as pretty as mine, but knew that the other team’s was more functional. It was a really fundamental moment in my growth as a designer, since I branched out significantly from my comfort zone and did some things that were really unique for me at the time. I also learned a lot about myself as a leader, since I ended up being the only person on my team with any real development experience, and was defaulted as the lead developer of the team. 
	
As to the code itself, while I was on a team of 8 people, I did end up writing most of the .aspx code completely on my own. Some of it was imitated by my teammates, and a lot of the classes were assigned to other people as well. However, I usually went back and cleaned up any of the code that I didn’t write, so almost all of it was code that I had a hand in somehow. Still, I was pretty proud to have basically taught 3/4ths of my team how to write ASP.NET, and taught the rest of the team how to architect an entire backend system.
